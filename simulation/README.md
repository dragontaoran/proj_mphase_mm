1. 20191017: The interim design evaluation step is not quite right. Each ACML and MI replicates need 2 hours and 2 days to finish.
2. 20191027: Delete the lm() fit to find the optimal design in the interim design evaluation step. Code seems to work for ACML.
3. 20191030: Get the lm() fit to find the optimal design in the interim design evaluation step back. Decrese the range of time.
4. 20191031: Change the range of time from 0-2 back to 0-5. Add a single-wave design using the 2:11:2 sample selection ratio.
